        I was first introduced to the web in 1999,  when my intro to computers teacher had the entire class create a Yahoo mail account. I have fond memories of using Altavista, Netscape Navigator and Ask Jeeves for my searches at a time when MySpace didn't exist and Napster flipped the music world on it's head. For me at the time, the web was basic. I'd hang out on campus and hope the collegeclub.com rep would post my picture so I could tell everyone to see me <q>online</q>. In my little world, the web changed once MySpace became a huge social hub and users could update their own photos and connect with friends who felt like they were lost forever. Then, it caught my attention.

        Today, the web is endless information. It is non-stop communication, social interaction, and op-ed pieces. It has ushered in the Information Age and filled the void with countless opportunities, possibilities, and ideas. The web is how we connect and it will continue to be that connector for the foreseeable future. Is see the future of the web as animated and interactive. The site <a href="http://medium.com" target="_blank">Medium</a> is where I noticed a transition from comment threads to direct responses and conversation. And this site, <a href="http://waaark.com/works/" target="_blank">Waaark</a> makes great use of animation and interaction. The future of the web is the design and code working in tandem to create a unique, and pleasant user experiences.
